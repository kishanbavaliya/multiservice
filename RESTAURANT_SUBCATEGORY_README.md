- **Products**: `hasMany(RestaurantProduct::class)`

### Indexes

- `restaurant_id` - For fast restaurant-based queries
- `category_id` - For fast category-based queries
- `restaurant_id + category_id` - Composite index for relationship queries
- `restaurant_id + category_id + is_active` - Composite index for active subcategories
- `sort_order` - For sorting operations

## File Storage

### Image Storage Paths
- **Subcategory Images**: `storage/app/public/restaurant-subcategories/images/`
- **Subcategory Icons**: `storage/app/public/restaurant-subcategories/icons/`

### File Management
- Images are automatically stored in organized folders
- Old images are automatically deleted when replaced
- File cleanup occurs on subcategory deletion
- Maximum file sizes enforced (2MB for images, 1MB for icons)

## Security Features

### Validation
- Required field validation
- File type validation (images only)
- File size limits
- Relationship validation (restaurant-category compatibility)

### Access Control
- Admin role required for web interface
- API authentication required for all endpoints
- Soft delete protection for data integrity

## Integration Points

### Restaurant Categories
- Subcategories are linked to restaurant categories
- Category view shows subcategory count
- Direct links from categories to subcategories

### Restaurant Products
- Products can be assigned to subcategories
- Subcategory view shows product count
- Hierarchical organization: Restaurant ‚Üí Category ‚Üí Subcategory ‚Üí Product

### Restaurant Management
- Subcategories are restaurant-specific
- Restaurant view shows all associated subcategories
- Bulk operations by restaurant

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive, clear names
- Avoid abbreviations
- Be consistent across similar subcategories

### Organization
- Use sort order for logical grouping
- Group related subcategories together
- Consider user experience when ordering

### Image Management
- Use appropriate image sizes
- Optimize images before upload
- Use consistent aspect ratios for icons

### Status Management
- Keep inactive subcategories for historical data
- Use featured status sparingly
- Regular review of active subcategories

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Images Not Displaying**
   - Check storage link: `php artisan storage:link`
   - Verify file permissions
   - Check image paths in database

2. **Validation Errors**
   - Ensure restaurant and category exist
   - Verify file types and sizes
   - Check required fields

3. **Relationship Errors**
   - Ensure category belongs to selected restaurant
   - Check foreign key constraints
   - Verify data integrity

### Performance Tips

1. **Database Optimization**
   - Use provided indexes
   - Limit result sets with pagination
   - Use eager loading for relationships

2. **Image Optimization**
   - Compress images before upload
   - Use appropriate formats (JPEG for photos, PNG for icons)
   - Consider implementing image resizing

3. **Caching**
   - Cache frequently accessed subcategories
   - Use Redis for session storage
   - Implement query result caching
